verview
This project was part of the Udacity Nanodegree "Programming for Data Science with Python".
We had to make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States:

- Chicago
- New York City and 
- Washington

We had to write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. 
We also wrote a script that takes in raw inputs to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
